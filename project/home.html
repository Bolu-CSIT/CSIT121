      <p>

        throughout the semester, including multiple labs focused on HTML, CSS, responsive
        design, and modern web development best practices.

        This site was designed as a cohesive web experience rather than a collection of
        separate assignments. Each page follows a consistent layout and design system
        to ensure usability, accessibility, and responsiveness across devices.
