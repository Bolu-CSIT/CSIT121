                This is my first webpage. At first, learning how to create a webpage felt like a lot 
                of work and seemed difficult because there were so many tags to remember. But with time,
                practice, and studying, I started to understand how to structure HTML the right way. This 
                made it easier for me to see how webpages are built and displayed.
                
            </p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify HTML elements</li>
                <li>Differentiate between content and HTML tags</li>
                <li>Validate an HTML document using an online validator</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                I also learned how to view HTML document locally in browser. I learned alot from the following webpages:
