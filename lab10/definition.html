         <h1>What is Verifiable Credential Data Integrity </h1>
         
         <p>Verifiable Credential Data Integrity refers to a method that ensures digital credentials such as digital IDs, certificates, or records are protected from tampering and can be trusted. 
        The system works using cryptographic proofs that show whether data has been changed or altered. Its operation always follows three main steps: Transformation, Hashing, and Proof Generation. These steps work together to convert data into a form that can be securely verified. 
        In short, data integrity gives digital documents a protective layer so others can confirm they are real.</p>

        <p>The first step in this process is Transformation, which prepares the data for hashing.
         A transformation algorithm changes data into a consistent and predictable format so the next step will produce stable results.
          A simple example is taking a list of names from a meeting, sorting them alphabetically by last name, and rewriting them one per line. 
          This ensures that even if the same names are listed differently at first, the transformation process always produces the same organized version.</p>

        <p>After transformation, the next step is Hashing, which uses a cryptographic hash function to create a unique identifier for the transformed data. 
        Hashing can be compared to a phone address book, where a person’s name leads to their specific number. In the same way, hashing takes the prepared data and generates a unique output.
         By the end of this step, the data is ready for the final stage of generating a proof.
        </p>
        <p> Proof Generation is the step where a special algorithm creates a value that protects the data from being changed. 
            It works like a digital seal that shows the information is real and has not been tampered with. 
            This idea is similar to putting a wax seal on a letter so others know it came from the right person and have not being tampered with. 
            Common examples of this include digital signatures, proofs of stake, and proofs of knowledge.</p>
