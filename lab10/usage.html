      <h1>How is Verifiable Credential Data Integrity used</h1>
        <p>Verifiable Credential Data Integrity is used in many real world systems where digital records must be trusted.One common use is in issuing digital student IDs or school certificates. 
             These documents are transformed, hashed, and given a cryptographic proof so schools or employers can verify them easily. 
             If someone tried to change the data such as the student’s name or graduation date the proof will break, and verification will fail. 
             This allows institutions to confirm authenticity instantly.</p>

        <p>Another important use is in employment verification, where companies issue verifiable digital records of work experience. 
        A cryptographic proof ensures that the employment record is legitimate and unaltered. When a job applicant presents this credential to another employer, the system performs the reverse process: transformation, hashing, and proof verification. 
        If the proof matches, the data is confirmed as genuine. This makes hiring faster and reduces the risk of forged job histories.</p>

        <p>Healthcare and government systems also use data integrity to protect sensitive digital credentials. 
        For example, digital vaccine records or digital driver’s licenses rely on cryptographic proofs to ensure the information has not been tampered with. 
        When someone presents these records at an airport, doctor’s office, or government agency, the verifying system repeats the same steps: transform the data, hash it, and check the proof. If all steps match, the credential is proven valid. 
        These real life uses show how Data Integrity builds trust across different sectors.</p>
