      <h1>Why is Verifiable Credential Data Integrity important </h1>
    <p> Verifiable Credential Data Integrity is important because it ensures that digital information cannot be altered or faked without it being detected.
         With so much personal and professional information stored online, being able to verify authenticity is important.
         Data Integrity shows whether documents like  certificate, ID, or medical record has been tampered with.
          Without this protection, digital records would be easy to forge or manipulate. Verifiable credential data integrity builds trust in digital systems and prevents fraud.</p>

         <p>The third step of the process, Proof Generation, plays a major role in protecting data and personal information.
          Proof generation uses a cryptographic technique to protect the data or show a level of trust that the verifier requires. 
          This step can be compared to using a wax seal on an envelope to prove who sent it and that it has not been opened. Examples of proof generation include digital signatures and proofs of knowledge.
         These types of cryptographic proofs help organizations verify data with confidence.</p>

         <p>Because digital services are now used for school, healthcare, employment, and government processes, maintaining data integrity is more important than ever. 
         When people submit digital credentials, those documents must be trustworthy across different systems. Data integrity helps institutions verify credentials instantly without needing to rely on human judgment. 
         It also protects user privacy by preventing unnecessary exposure of sensitive information. Overall, it ensures secure communication and reliable information sharing in a digital world.
