      <h2>Lab 02</h2>

        This is my first webpage. At first, learning how to create a webpage felt like a lot 
        of work and seemed difficult because there were so many tags to remember. But with time,
        practice, and studying, I started to understand how to structure HTML the right way.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify HTML elements</li>
        <li>Differentiate between content and HTML tags</li>
        <li>Validate an HTML document using an online validator</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I also learned how to view an HTML document locally in a browser. I learned a lot from these webpages:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content" target="_blank">HTML Basics</a></li>
        <br>

        In this lab, I learned how to design a blog page so it looks good on both mobile devices and desktop computers. I used tools like flexbox, grid, and media queries to make the design flexible and responsive to different screen sizes
      </p>
      <h4><b>Best Design Practices I Follow</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Keep layout simple and consistent across pages</li>
        <li>Use responsive design for both mobile and desktop users</li>
        <li>Choose readable fonts and accessible color contrasts</li>
      </ol>
