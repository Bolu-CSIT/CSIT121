    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Completing this final project helped me understand the importance of planning,
      organization, and consistency when building a multi-page website. One of the
      biggest challenges was making sure all pages were linked correctly and shared
      the same design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Testing the website on different browsers and devices showed me how layout
      and spacing can change depending on screen size. Using responsive design
      techniques helped me improve usability for both mobile and desktop users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this course helped me build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS while
      also teaching me best practices for responsive design, accessibility, and
      modern web standards.
