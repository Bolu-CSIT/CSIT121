        This is my first webpage. At first, learning how to create a webpage felt like a lot 
        of work and seemed difficult because there were so many tags to remember. But with time,
        practice, and studying, I started to understand how to structure HTML the right way.

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify HTML elements</li>
        <li>Differentiate between content and HTML tags</li>
        <li>Validate an HTML document using an online validator</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I also learned how to view an HTML document locally in a browser. I learned a lot from these webpages:
